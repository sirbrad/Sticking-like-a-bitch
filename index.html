				<h2>Watch me stick!</h2>
				<p>This spot is the part that STICKS! I've only attempted this with text atm, but I'm silently confident most things should be suitable like an image or video.</p>
				<p>The height of this element should matter THAT much as we grab it with javaScript. The only thing your have to watch out for is the smoothness when scrolling past the element. You see what I mean.</p>
