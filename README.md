<h1>Sticking like a bitch</h1>
<p>Fix positions an element depending on how far they have scrolled. Works with multiple elements, as in once the user scrolls further the fixed element becomes position absolute to the bottom of its container and scrolls off leaving space for the next element to scroll up and be fixed.</p>
<h2>Things to do</h2>
<p>My jsFiddle demo is built to be responsive, and it seems there is a weird bug when setting position fixed to an element that has it's width set in percentages? Would love to hear anyone's ideas on why/how this happens.</p>
<p>So fixing that would be great. And also it's not a very good experience on a mobile. When I get time, I'll have a go at checking for device's and not applying the classes. For the time being, using media queries you could  override the classnames&hellip; Although that would be a dirty nasty trick!</p>
<p>Last but not least I'd like to turn this into a jQuery plugin, but that is definitely last on the list!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
